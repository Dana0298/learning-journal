### *Markdown Notes* 

Markdown is a super simple way to add formatting like headers, bold, bulleted lists, and so on to plain text. It's simpler than HTML and you don't have to worry about opening and closing tags. 

#### Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

#### Styling text
Use the following symbols before and after the text.
* For Bold use ** ** or __ __ 
* For Italic use * * or _ _
* For Strikethrough use ~~ ~~

#### Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). 

#### List
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.

To order your list, precede each line with a number.
