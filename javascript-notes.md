**JavaScript**: it's where you can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. 

action / flight / Behavior Layer

data types:  numbers, strings, booleans
what do we call these:  = , == , ===

Aim to keep the three languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in separate files, withthe HTML page linking to CSS and JavaScript files. 

Some people browse with JavaScript turned off, so you need to make sure that the page still works for them. 

### **How to use objects & methods**
 `document.write('Good afternoon!');`
 * The **document** object represent the entire web page. 
 * the **write()** method of the document object allows new content to be written into the page where the `<script>` element sits. 

Javascript runs where it is found in the HTML

When there's a `<script>` the browser will stop to load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything. 

`<script src="js/add-content.js"></script>`
