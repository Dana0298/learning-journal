# **Text Editor Notes**

What is a text editor? A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text.

The following are **features** that you should look for in a text editor
* **Code completion**:allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed.
* **Syntax highlighting**: takes the text you type and makes it more noticable by coloring the text. 
* **Themes**:having series of themes available
* **Extensions**:you can add more features to the text editor with extension. 

### Text Editor on computer
Every computer will come with its own text editor however there is no code completion, no syntax highlighting, no themes and no extensions. They’re the barest bare bones text editors you’ll encounter.


* **Mac computers** the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Text Edit.” 
* **Windows computers** the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.”
* **Linux computers** each distribution will have its own text editor already installed

### 3rd Party Text Editor
There is software like: Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text (these are all free of charge). They can be downloaded and installed on your computer. Not every software is available to Windows, MAC, or Linux computers. Each of these titles do have some if not all of the features that were listed above. 

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

# **The Terminal (AKA: The Command Line Interface (cli))**
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

* A command ( ls ). Typically a command is always the first thing you type.
* The first command line argument ( -l ) is also referred to as an option. Options are typically used to modify the behaviour of the command. Options are usually listed before other arguments and typically start with a dash ( - )
* there must be a space between the command and the first command line argument

* mkdir *name of folder*: To create a new folder and name it. 
* ls: it lists all the files and directories in the current directory that you are on.
* cd *name of folder*/: will bring you inside that folder
* pwd: it will spit out the exact file path for the file or folder you are in
* cd .. :  To navigate up one directory level
* code . : takes you to VS code
