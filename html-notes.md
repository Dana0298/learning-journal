# HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
HTML describes the structure of a Web page. It's the bare bones of a site. 

### KEY WORDS
**Semantic HTML** -it implies meaning. In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page: 
- article
- side
- details
- figure
- footer
- header

Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span - Tells nothing about its content. 

**Tags, opening and closing**: Everything you do in a web page is using tags. There are opening tags \<H2> and closing tags \</H2> 

**Self-closing tag**: The tags that aren’t required to have specific closing tags are called “self closing” tags. 
For examples: 
- \<img /> 
- \<area />
- \<col />

**Attributes**: Attributes provide additional information about an element. Attributes are always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

## Process to follow when creating a new website.

### Who is the site for? Why people visit your site? What your visitors are trying to achieve? What information your visitor need? How often people will visit your site.

Every website is designed for the target audience, not for myself or the site owner

* Target Audience: You would use the information below if you have a question about how the site is going to be used or what its priorities should be.
    * Individuals
            - Age; men, women, or both,; where do they live-urban, rural; income of visitors; level of education; marital or family status; their occupation; hours they work; how often do they use the web; what kind of device they use to access the web?
    * Companies
            - Size of the company; position of people in the company that will use the site; site used for themselves or for someone else; how large is the budget they control?

You would use the information above if you have a question about how the site is going to be used or what its priorities should be. 

**To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are 2 basic categories of questions you can ask:** 

	1. The first attempts to discover the motivations for why visitors come to the site? Entertainment, personal or professional, essential or luxury?

    2. The second examines the specific goals of the visitors. These are the  triggers making them come to the site now. General info, after something specific (particular fact or info on product), already familiar or need to be introduced, time sensitive info,  need info to decide if to buy, do they need to contact you? 

Working out how often people are likely to revisit your site give you an indication for how often you should update the site. Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Such as news may be constantly changing. 

# Site Maps

Once you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the info into section or pages. The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site and how those pages can be grouped. Can use the card sorting technique 

# Wireframes

A wireframes is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require. This includes sketching where each element of the page will go (such as the logo, primary navigation, headings and main bodies of text, user logins etc). Does not include color schemes, font choices, backgrounds or images. 

##  **Design**

The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. 

## Visual Hierarchy 

Refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first. Images often attract the eye first. 
 
- Size
- Color
- Style

## Grouping and Similarity

Organizing: Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks makes the page look simpler (and easier to understand)

- Proximity
- Closure
- Continuance
- White Space
- Color
- Borders

## Designing Navigation

Good navigation tends to follow these principles
- Concise: no more than 8 links
- Clear: single descriptive words rather than phrases
- Selective: do not include logins and search, and legal info like terms and conditions. 
- Context: Use a different color or some king of visual marker to indicate the current page. 
- Interactive: Appearance of a link should change when hovered over and should also be visually distinct from other content on the page. 
- Consistent: The more pages a site contains, the larger the number of navigation items there will be. Although secondary navigation will change from page to page, it is best to keep the primary navigation exactly the same. 

# **Ch 1 Structure**

- HTML pages are text documents
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning
- Tags are often referred to as elements
- There are opening tags and closing tags
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element
- Attributes require a name and a value

DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.

You can add comments to your code between the \<!-- and --> markers

The id an class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

The \<div> and \<span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

\<iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed

The \<meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and &#169;
