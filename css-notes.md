# CSS Notes

**CSS** - cascading style sheet - presentation / style / feathers on the bird. It provides the style of the website. 

inheritance - means an element's style values are copied from it's parent element

anatomy of css - rules, selector, declaration, property (multiple?) value

3 ways to specify colors in cCSS:
* color names - blue-true

* RGB values rgba - red/green/blue opacity (how translucent)

* hex codes - #EE3E80
color by name 147

hsl hsla - hue saturation lightness (opacity)
    opacity / alpha / transparency

Scalibility - how scalable is your site. How many people will use that site?

CSS rule has 2 parts
* selector
* declaration

p {font-family: Arial}
* p = selector
* font-family: Ariel = Declaration

Selectors are elements.

Commonly used CSS selectors:
* Universal selector: * {} Targets all elements
* Type selector: h1, h2, h3 {}
* Class selector: .note {}
* ID selector: #introduction {}
* Child selector: li>/a {}
* Descendant selector: p a {}
* Adjacent sibling selector: h1+p {}
* General sibling selector: h1~ {}

Declarations has a property & value, separated by a colon. 

property = aspects of the element
* color, font, width, height, border, etc

An example of a value = yellow, ariel

attribute examples: href class, id, styke, src

 2 major sections are the head which is necessary for the site and the body. The head includes info about the site. The body (includes the part rendered to page)
