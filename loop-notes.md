- ```&&``` Logical and
- ```||``` Logical or
-```!``` Logical not

### Loops

- 3 common types of loops:    
    - For loops: This instructs the code to run a specified number of times.


    ```for (var i = 0; i < 10;i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }```

    - While loops:  will do the thing until not true

    ```var name = prompt(what\'s your name?';
    var attemptsAllowed = 2;
    var attempted = 0

    while(name ==='' && attempted !== attemptsAllowed) {
        name = prompt(what\'s your name darnit!?)
        attempted++;
    }```

    while (i < 9 ){
        console.log(i);
        i++;
    } 

    - Do while
