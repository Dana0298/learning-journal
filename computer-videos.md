# **What makes a computer, a computer?**
4 things common to all computers:

- Takes input. takes information in.
    - different types of input. These tell the computer what to do: with a keyboard, mouse, a microphone, camera, car, touchscreen can sense finger  etc 

- Store information as data
        
- A computer's processor takes information from   memory, it munipulates it (changes it) using algorithm(series of commands), sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again

- Output the results

## **Binary & Data**

All comes down to these 1's and 0's, and the electrical signals in the circuits behind them. It;s the backbone on how a computer works.

Inside a computer there are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information.

Bit: A single binary digit. One single wire, can represent an one/off, yes/no, true/false, 1/0, or anything else with only 2 options. This is the smallest piece of information that a computer can store. More wires = more bits.

110100 = 6 bits

Binary number system: there are only 2 digits, 0 & 1. With these two digits we can count up to any number. 

- There's the 1's position, 
- There's the 2's position,
- There's the 4's position,
- There's the 8's position, and so on.

Text, images and sound can be represented by numbers.  

## **Circuits and logic**
Every input and output is type of information. 

A simple circuit. Takes a simple cicuit (electical signal), on or off, and flips it. These perform calculations. 

## **Hardware and software**

Hardware of a computing device: you can have circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs, other stuff. 

Software: all the computer programs(codes) running on this machine. apps, games, web pages.

CPU (Central Processing Unit): is the master chip that controls all nthe other parts of the computer. The CPU knows which circuits to use and when to use them.
